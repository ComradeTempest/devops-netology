1. Юзера отредактировали через конcоль управления, бэкенд зарегистрировали добавлением кусочка в main.tf

```
  backend "s3" {
    endpoint   = "storage.yandexcloud.net"
    bucket     = "netology-s3"
    region     = "ru-central1"
    key        = "./terraform.tfstate"
    access_key = "yc_ak"
    secret_key = "yc_sk"
    skip_region_validation      = true
    skip_credentials_validation = true
  }
}
```
2. Докидываем воркспейсы через terraform workspace new prod и terraform workspace new stage

Вывод воркспейсов:

```
test@netology:~/7.3$ terraform workspace list
  default
  prod
* stage
```
Свитчимся на прод через terraform workspace select prod, делаем plan (токены потёр)

```
test@netology:~/7.3$ terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
